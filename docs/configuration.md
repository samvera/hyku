## Single Tenant Mode

Much of the default configuration in Hyku is set up to use multi-tenant mode. This default mode allows Hyku users to run the equivielent of multiple Hyrax installs on a single set of resources. However, sometimes the subdomain splitting multi-headed complexity is simply not needed. If this is the case, then single tenant mode is for you. Single tenant mode will not show the tenant sign up page, or any of the tenant management screens. Instead it shows a single Samvera instance at what ever domain is pointed at the application.

To enable single tenant, set `HYKU_MULTITENANT=false` in your `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.production.yml` configs. After changinig this setting, run `rails db:seed` to prepopulate the single tenant.

In single tenant mode, both the application root (eg. localhost, or hyku.test) and the tenant url single.\* (eg. single.hyku.test) will load the tenant. Override the root host by setting HYKU_ROOT_HOST`.

To change from single- to multi-tenant mode, change the multitenancy/enabled flag to true and restart the application. Change the 'single' tenant account cname in the Accounts edit interface to the correct hostname.

## Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Setup

Hyku supports Google Analytics 4 for tracking user interactions and generating analytics reports. GA4 was added in Hyku v6.0 and provides tenant-specific analytics isolation.

> **📖 Complete Setup Guide:** For detailed instructions, see the [official Samvera GA4 documentation](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/hyku/pages/3185147970/Google+Analytics+4+GA4+Support#Creating-a-New-Google-Analytics-Account)

### Quick Setup Overview

#### 1. 🌐 Global Administrator Setup

**Google Cloud Console:**

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Create a **Service Account** (ends with `@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Generate and download the **JSON key file**
4. Enable **Google Analytics Data API**

**Google Analytics:**

1. Create GA4 **Properties** (one per tenant for data isolation)
2. Add your **Service Account email** to each property with **Viewer** access
3. Note the **Measurement ID** (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`) and **Property ID** (numeric) for each

#### 2. 🔧 Developer Environment Setup

**Required Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Enable GA4 globally
HYRAX_ANALYTICS=true
HYRAX_ANALYTICS_REPORTING=true
HYRAX_ANALYTICS_PROVIDER=ga4

# Global fallback IDs (optional)
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY_ID=123456789

# Service Account JSON (required)
GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"your-service@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",...}'
```

**For Docker Compose:** Add to your `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` file.
**For Production:** Set as environment variables or secrets.

#### 3. 🏢 Tenant Configuration

Each tenant configures their specific GA4 property in **Admin → Settings:**

- **Google Analytics ID**: Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
- **Google Analytics Property ID**: Numeric Property ID (`123456789`)
- Enable **Analytics** and **Analytics Reporting** checkboxes

### 🔐 Security & Access

- **Service Account** must have **Viewer** access to each GA4 property
- **JSON key** should be stored securely (environment variables, not in code)
- Each tenant gets isolated analytics data from their dedicated GA4 property

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No data showing:**

- Verify service account has access to the GA4 property
- Check that the Measurement ID format is correct (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
- Ensure `GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable is properly escaped

**Authentication errors:**

- Verify the JSON key is valid and properly formatted
- Check that Google Analytics Data API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure the service account email exists in GA4 property access management

### 📊 Analytics Features

When properly configured, Hyku provides:

- **Page views** and **visitor analytics**
- **Work and collection** view statistics
- **File download** tracking
- **Dashboard reports** with tenant-specific data isolation
- **Optional email reports** to depositors

### 🔄 Legacy Universal Analytics

⚠️ **Universal Analytics (UA) is deprecated.** Google stopped processing UA data on July 1, 2023. Migrate to GA4 for continued analytics support.

## Working with Translations

You can log all of the I18n lookups to the Rails logger by setting the I18N_DEBUG environment variable to true. This will add a lot of chatter to the Rails logger (but can be very helpful to zero in on what I18n key you should or could use).

```console
$ I18N_DEBUG=true bin/rails server
```

## S3 Like Storage

You can upload your primary works to S3 in Valkyrie mode by turning on `REPOSITORY_S3_STORAGE` and setting the accompanying bucket and credentials variables. This enables both AWS S3 and other S3 like storage engines such as Minio. As of this writing this only affects Valkyrie resources and only the primary storage. Derivatives, uploads and branding assets all still go to the shared storage directories.
