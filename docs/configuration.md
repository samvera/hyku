## Single Tenant Mode

Much of the default configuration in Hyku is set up to use multi-tenant mode. This default mode allows Hyku users to run the equivielent of multiple Hyrax installs on a single set of resources. However, sometimes the subdomain splitting multi-headed complexity is simply not needed. If this is the case, then single tenant mode is for you. Single tenant mode will not show the tenant sign up page, or any of the tenant management screens. Instead it shows a single Samvera instance at what ever domain is pointed at the application.

To enable single tenant, set `HYKU_MULTITENANT=false` in your `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.production.yml` configs. After changinig this setting, run `rails db:seed` to prepopulate the single tenant.

In single tenant mode, both the application root (eg. localhost, or hyku.test) and the tenant url single.\* (eg. single.hyku.test) will load the tenant. Override the root host by setting HYKU_ROOT_HOST`.

To change from single- to multi-tenant mode, change the multitenancy/enabled flag to true and restart the application. Change the 'single' tenant account cname in the Accounts edit interface to the correct hostname.

## Controlled Vocabularies

## Analytics Configuration

For detailed information about configuring analytics in Hyku, see the [Analytics Configuration Guide](./analytics.md).

## Working with Translations

You can log all of the I18n lookups to the Rails logger by setting the I18N_DEBUG environment variable to true. This will add a lot of chatter to the Rails logger (but can be very helpful to zero in on what I18n key you should or could use).

```console
$ I18N_DEBUG=true bin/rails server
```

## S3 Like Storage

You can upload your primary works to S3 in Valkyrie mode by turning on `REPOSITORY_S3_STORAGE` and setting the accompanying bucket and credentials variables. This enables both AWS S3 and other S3 like storage engines such as Minio. As of this writing this only affects Valkyrie resources and only the primary storage. Derivatives, uploads and branding assets all still go to the shared storage directories.
