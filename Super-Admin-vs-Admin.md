To describe the difference between a Super Admin and an Admin, let’s use the analogy of an apartment. There is an apartment with Building Managers. The Building Managers do not originally have access to individual units. They do however have the ability to give tenants access to the individual apartment units they’ll be renting. This includes the ability to grant themselves access to the individual units. In Hyku, we call these Building Managers the ‘Super Admin.’ Granting Super Admin access does not mean one suddenly has administrative access to all the repositories. To be able to have Admin access within the individual tenants of the apartment, one must be specifically granted administrator access for each library’s repository. The Super Admin is able to give themselves the access they need to all of the library’s repositories. 

# Super Admin Rights 

A Super Admin will see the ‘Accounts’ and ‘Users’ links. The ‘Accounts’ link is where Super Admins have the ability to create library repositories and manage the users for the specific repositories. This includes giving users Account Administration (‘Admin’) access.  The ‘Users’ link will be where Super Admin can create Users to see the central Commons Archive index of all the institutions and grant Super Admin access to those users. 

To be able to access all the institutions, a User will need to be given ‘Admin’ access via each of the individual repositories.  

# Admin Rights 

To be given ‘Admin’ rights for the different institutions, there are two ways to accomplish this. The first is through the Super Admin’s ‘Accounts’ link. 

Home → Account → Manage Account → Current Account Administrators → All Users → Add button (next to individual User). 

The second is through the individual repository, where ‘Admin’, not necessarily ‘Super Admin’, are able to grant ‘Admin’ Access. 

Click on the specific library from the Commons Archive index view → Manage Users
