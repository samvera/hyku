# Hyku Version Policy - draft

Our goal is to follow [semver](https://semver.org), and to specify here what we believe that means in regard to Hyku, a directly deployable product.

## Major Version

It is our goal to provide a smooth upgrade path for all deployments of Hyku whenever possible. As such major versions will used any time we require data updates, reindexing or other "on deploy" changes

## Minor Version

This will be any new features that do not require any data migration or other on deploy changes

## Patch Level

Patch level will be incremented whenever small bug fixes or security patches are applied.
