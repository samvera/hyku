## As a non-signed in user:

- [ ] I can see a list of each institution
  - [ ] Each institution has a display of their theme logo (or a placeholder if there is no logo)
  - [ ] I can click on the link for each institution, which directs me to the tenant for that institution
- [ ] I can click on the link to Administrator login (in the footer), which directs me to the Log in form
- [ ] I can select my preferred language from the Language dropdown menu
  - [ ] Selecting a language only sets the language for the current site, not for each of the individual tenants
